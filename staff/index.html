Interns work at CCF for one year, they live at the house and they are a huge part of making CCF run. This includes leading small groups, preparing food for events, heading up different ministry groups, investing in students, creating a fun &amp; safe environment for students in the Tech community and many other important aspects of CCF. Each intern is assigned a certain ministry group for the year, which is broken up into Freshmen, Sophomores, Upperclassmen, and Compassion.
