After Georgia Tech, Jordan continued her studies at Emmanuel Christian Seminary at Milligan College, where she earned a Masters of Divinity in 2017.

      <div class="col-md-10"><h4>Every year a group of recent graduates of Georgia Tech (and occasionally other schools) decide that they want to give back to the CCF community that has meant so much to them during their time in college. Interns work at CCF for one year, they live at the house and they are a huge part of making CCF run. This includes leading small groups, preparing food for events, heading up different ministry groups, investing in students, creating a fun &amp; safe environment for students in the Tech community and many other important aspects of CCF. Each intern is assigned a certain ministry group for the year, which is broken up into Freshmen, Sophomores, and Upperclassmen.
