Interns work at CCF for one year, they live at the house and they are a huge part of making CCF run. This includes leading small groups, preparing food for events, heading up different ministry groups, investing in students, creating a fun &amp; safe environment for students in the Tech community and many other important aspects of CCF. Each intern is assigned a certain ministry group for the year, which is broken up into Freshmen, Sophomores, and Upperclassmen.

I came back to Tech in the spring with the promise that I would dive in and get connected. I have never once regretted that decision. Crying at Agape nights, retreats at Judy Chastain’s house, Juarez, late night dance parties, and conversations with some really good people will live on as my best memories at Tech. Most importantly, CCF is a community that centers itself around Jesus Christ, and reminds me that my life would be empty without His love. </em></div></div>
