          Georgia Tech Christian Campus Fellowship is about genuine community, having fun, and being a place for everyone. We are a diverse campus ministry that welcomes people of different backgrounds, beliefs and denominations. CCF explores what it means to follow Jesus as we live, serve, eat, grow, and laugh together. <br> <br> We offer <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/events/weekly/">opportunities</a> to get involved every week, ranging from free food and trivia to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/events/compassion/">service opportunities</a> and small groups. A team of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/staff/">staff</a>, interns, and student leaders help make everything happen. Take a look around the website or swing by the campus house any time. We would love to meet you and share more information on how to get connected.
