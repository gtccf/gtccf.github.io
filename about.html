          <h4><br />Who are we?</h4>
          CCF is a community of Georgia Tech students living life, serving, and growing together in Christian faith.  There are tons of activities and ways to get involved, so take a look and jump into one of the many opportunities! CCF is a Christian organization at Georgia Tech founded in 1987 by our campus minister, Rick Harper, and his wife Beth. Our focus is sharing the love of God with students at Georgia Tech and the wider Atlanta community.
