          Big Kid on Campus is a day of fun at CCF and on Georgia Tech's campus for kids, siblings, sons, daughters, and grandchildren affected by cancer. We will have games, video games, a bounce house, crafts, makeovers, snacks, lunch, movies, and a Santa appearance. We also plan to play kickball with the GT Softball Team and have gym time with the GT Volleyball Team. Lunch is provided and the event is no cost to you! Feel free to drop off kids for a day of relaxation or Christmas shopping, or stay and hang out in our parents' lounge upstairs with internet access, TV, and snacks. We will have lots of adult volunteers - usually a ratio of at least 1 volunteer for every 2 kids. A registered nurse will be present all day. We will serve Chick-Fil-A for lunch and have plenty to go around. Kids can come for all or part of the day.
