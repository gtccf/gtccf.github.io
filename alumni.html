          <strong>Feed a Hungry College Student</strong><br><br>
          <em><strong>Feeding Frenzy</strong></em><br>Every Thursday night before Bible Study, GT CCF offers its students a free dinner called “Feeding Frenzy” beginning at 6:30pm. About 400 students normally attend Feeding Frenzy. Your group can bring food that is already prepared (fast food, barbeque, sub sandwiches, etc.) or use our kitchen to cook dinner here. Student favorites include lasagna, burritos, barbeque sandwiches, and grilled cheese sandwiches and soup. You can sponsor a Feeding Frenzy by either providing food or providing a donation of $400.00.<br><br>
          <em><strong>Devo Lunch</strong></em><br>Each Monday, students gather for devotional lunch, or “devo” lunch, which includes a free lunch and a short. We offer two sessions of devo lunch at 11am and 12pm every Monday. About 200 students (an average of 100 students per session) attend devo lunch each week. This is especially effective in allowing students to invite their friends from class to come by CCF for a free lunch. You can sponsor both lunches ($400), one lunch ($200), or partially support a devo lunch.<br><br>
          <em><strong>Adopt-A-Van</strong></em><br>GTCCF attends four retreats every school year, one of which is held at Panama City Beach, Florida. For this retreat, we rent 15 person passenger vans to ensure safe travel for our staff and students. CCF subsidizes the cost of the vans to make the retreats affordable to students, so this is a definite need in order to make these trips feasible. The vans cost $500 each for three days, and we usually rent 15-18 vans per retreat. You may also choose to “purchase” a van for the retreat for $500.00, a bench for $125.00, or a seat for $50.00.<br><br></div>

          Thanks for your interest in donating to CCF! We are fully funded by donations and we are a 501 c (3) non-profit organization, so all of your gifts are tax deductible! Each gift goes towards impacting a student's life for Jesus Christ.
          <br><br>
          Please contact Ashley (Hightower) Teffeau with any questions concerning giving at <a href="mailto:ashleyccf@gmail.com">ashleyccf@gmail.com</a>.
          <br><br>
          Our greatest need is monthly operational giving. Our operational budget funds all of the free meals, programs, events, staffing, campus, and everything else needed to fulfill our mission.
          <br><br>
          <strong>One–Time Gifts and Gifts-In-Kind</strong> are also needed to help GTCCF reach out to students. Please see below some various current one time needs or contact Ashley with any additional needs.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Stock Gifts</strong> are also accepted and sold immediately after the transfer is made. By selling the stocks it allows the donor to donate the amount they intended to and will go directly to the ministry for use.
          <br><br>
          To give to GTCCF we have various methods of payment: autodraft, PayPal, and checks.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Auto Draft Form – </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzjXf4TYaU7VV0VueFFxQjh0bFk/edit">Download the form</a> to begin autodraft. It is our most common giving method for monthly givers. You can set automatic withdrawls for free by filling out the form and sending it in by snail mail or making the approprioate edits to the form and attaching it in an email to <a href="mailto:ashleyccf@gmail.com">Ashley.</a>
