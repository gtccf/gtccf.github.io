      <div class="col-md-10"><h4>Compassion Week 2019 is a week where we strive to answer the question of why we serve.  Taking place here at CCF March 4th - March 10th, we will focus on a different topical issue that impacts the lives of people here in America each day of the week.  Together we will learn, experience, grow, and do as we explore these topics and try to put ourselves in the shoes of our neighbors. You are invited to participate with us in several ways:</h4>

      <br>

              Did you know that 93% of the poorest school districts in America have test scores below the national average? Likewise, only 1.6% of the richest school districts in America have mean test scores at or below the national average. (Sources: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/05/education-inequality-takes-center-stage/483405/">1</a>, <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/reardon%20district%20ses%20and%20achievement%20discussion%20draft%20april2016.pdf">2</a>). On Monday, we will be talking about the state of education in America - what's good, what's not so good, what we can do to help and why we want to serve!

              <br> <br>

              Join us by giving up Google (or the ability to utilize an online search engine) for the day, and help us get the conversation going.

            <div class="col-md-8"><div class="blue"><strong><h4><br />Electricity</strong> <br> No Power | March 5th</h4></div>
              After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September of 2017, its 3.4 million residents lost power, and 7 months later 100,000 of those residents still lacked power. It took 11 months to fully restore electricity, and it was deemed the largest blackout in U.S. history (and the second largest in world history). (Sources: <a href="https://rhg.com/research/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-worlds-second-largest-blackout/">1</a>, <a href="https://rhg.com/research/americas-biggest-blackout-2/">2</a>). There are many other Americans that go without electricity as a way of life or because of a natural disaster, and on Tuesday we will be highlighting what it means to have no electricity available for use.

              <br> <br>

              Join us for Caf√® Unplugged Tuesday at 8pm, and for the whole day we will be attempting to not use electricity - do what you can to put yourselves in the shoes of our neighbors and help us talk about ways we can serve!

            <div class="col-md-8"><div class="blue"><strong><h4><br />Health</strong> <br> No Food | March 6th</h4></div>
              40 million people in the United States of America are food insecure, including 12 million children (meaning they have limited or uncertain availability to nutritionally adequate and safe foods). (Sources: <a href="https://whyhunger.org/just-the-facts/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/90023/err-256.pdf?v=0">2</a>). Health issues, ranging from malnutrition problems to mental health obstacles, are still very real in America, and there are certainly real solutions that we will be talking about on Wednesday.

              <br> <br>

              Join us at CCF at 12pm as we give up a meal for a "No Lunch But Learn" with Derek Sweatman from Atlanta Christian Church and learn about important ways we can help right here at home.

              The bad news is that over 500,000 Americans are homeless (as of 2017). The good news is that more and more of these people are able to transition to having permenant shelter and housing, and it's getting better each year! (Sources: <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-report/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/ahar/#2017-reports">2</a>). On Thursday we will be talking about tackling housing issues, and you're invited to be a part of that conversation!

              <br> <br>

              Please join us on Thursday Night at CCF for our hunger banquet at 6:45PM where we will experience what is like to not be as blessed with our availability of food (note: prepare for this to be an abnormal meal). Our after-activity for the night will be a sleepout in the North Ave Quad where we will have fun together and get a taste of being out in the elements for a night!

            <div class="col-md-8"><div class="blue"><strong><h4><br />Water & Sanitation</strong> <br> No Water | March 8th</h4></div>
              Clean water is a basic human right, but 14 million households (or roughly 12%) struggle to pay for clean water (as of 2014). This is a number that is trending upward as affordability of clean water is decreasing for many households in America.  (Sources: <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/5/9/15183330/america-water-crisis-affordability-millions">1</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169488">2</a>). On Friday we will be talking about water and sanitation problems and solutions and what we can do make clean water more available to our neighbors and the world.

              <br> <br>

              You are invited to participate with us on Friday as we try to learn and grow together by living off of only 1 gallon of water for the day.
