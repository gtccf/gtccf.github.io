          <p>Do you know why the GTCCF house is open every day of the week? Do you know why Georgia Tech students stream in and out of the campus house for Bible studies, lunches, meetings, ping pong matches, counseling, and general downtime? Do you know why they worship, study, eat, gather, and play here?</p>
          <p>It's because people like you--alumni, parents, and friends--give to this ministry.</p>
          <p>It feels like a cliché, but there is solid truth in the idea that every dollar matters. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/alumni/message-from-board/"><em>read more...</em></a></p></div>

          <strong>Feed a Hungry College Student</strong><br><br>
          <em><strong>Free Dinner at Thursday Nights</strong></em><br>Every Thursday night, GT CCF offers its students Free Dinner which used to be called “Feeding Frenzy.”  Free Dinner begins at 6:45pm with close to 200 students.  If you would like to sponsor a meal, contact Neal to see what dates are available.  There is always a need!  Your group can bring food that is already prepared (lasagna, barbeque, sub sandwiches, etc.) or use our industrial kitchen to cook dinner here at the campus house. Student favorites include lasagna, potato bar, barbeque sandwiches, and taco salad. You can sponsor a Free Dinner by either providing food or providing a donation of $400.00.<br><br>
          <em><strong>Devo Lunch</strong></em><br>Each Monday, students gather for devotional lunch, or “devo” lunch, which includes a free lunch and a short. We offer two sessions of devo lunch at 11am and 12pm every Monday. About 200 students (an average of 100 students per session) attend devo lunch each week. This is especially effective in allowing students to invite their friends from class to come by CCF for a free lunch. You can sponsor both lunches ($400), one lunch ($200), or partially support a devo lunch.<br><br>
          <strong>Help with a Retreat</strong><br><br>
          <em><strong>Sponsor a Student</strong></em><br>We have four retreats a year.  Retreats are where life change really happens.  It is an opportunity for students to get away from campus and hear solid wisdom and truth.  Students have free time to have fun and build community. There is even time for prayer and worship.  Many times there are faith commitments made, baptisms and rejoicing!  It is a truly a refreshing time!  Students retreats vary from $35-$85. <br><br>
          <em><strong>Adopt-A-Van</strong></em><br>GTCCF attends four retreats every school year, one of which is held at Panama City Beach, Florida. For this retreat, we rent 15 person passenger vans to ensure safe travel for our staff and students. CCF subsidizes the cost of the vans to make the retreats affordable to students, so this is a definite need in order to make these trips feasible. We rent close to 20 vans at $500 each.  If you would like to Adopt a Van you can give towards a van for $500.00, a bench for $125.00, or a seat for $50.00.<br><br></div>

          Thanks for your interest in donating to CCF! We are fully funded by donations and we are a 501 c (3) non-profit organization, so all of your gifts are tax deductible! Each gift goes towards impacting a student's life for Jesus Christ.
          <br><br>
          Please contact Neal Baker with any questions concerning giving at <a href="mailto:baker@gtccf.org">baker@gtccf.org</a>.
          <br><br>
          Our greatest need is monthly operational giving. Our operational budget funds all of the free meals, programs, events, staffing, campus, and everything else needed to fulfill our mission.
          <br><br>
          <strong>One–Time Gifts and Gifts-In-Kind</strong> are also needed to help GTCCF reach out to students. Please see below some various current one time needs or contact Neal with any additional needs.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Stock Gifts</strong> are also accepted and sold immediately after the transfer is made. By selling the stocks it allows the donor to donate the amount they intended to and will go directly to the ministry for use.
          <br><br>
          To give to GTCCF we have various methods of payment: autodraft, PayPal, and checks.
          <br><br>
