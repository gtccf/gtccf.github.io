          <br>
          By now you’ve probably realized that there are a million things to know about this campus and its people... and all of that can feel a little overwhelming at times. Thankfully, there are a ton of people who are already rooting for you! We at CCF (Christian Campus Fellowship) are some of those people.<br>
          We are a diverse campus ministry, full of people from different backgrounds and beliefs, whose goal is to live like Jesus and show others that they are loved. Our community aims to treat all people with dignity and respect, and we hope that our hospitality says enough about who we are more than any words could. CCF is a home away from home for many students, and we’d love to be yours, too.<br>
          Every week we’ll have tons of opportunities to get involved, so stop by whenever to get better connected with our community!

The relationships that I’ve built over the years have been some of the best I’ve had yet.

          <strong>Fun Fact: </strong>For a while, I unofficially held the world record for most Rubick's cubes solved on a unicycle.<br><br>

          <div class="blue"><em>If you were to ask me all the ways that CCF has changed my life over the five years I've been in this community, I could probably write a short novel on the subject, so I won't try. But I can say that after being immersed in a community centered around the love of Jesus, being supported by loving staff and friends, and living in a space where I'm open to ask big questions about life and faith, it's not possible to come out the other side unchanged. And I am just one person! Knowing that there have been and will be so many more lives changed by discovering and rediscovering the living God through CCF, there's nothing I'd rather do than pour back into the community that has so consistently displayed God's love for everyone at Georgia Tech.</em></div></div>
