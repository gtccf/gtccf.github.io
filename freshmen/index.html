          By now you’ve probably realized that there are a million things to know about this campus and its people... and all of that can feel a little overwhelming at times. Thankfully, there are a ton of people who are already rooting for you! We at CCF (Christian Campus Fellowship) are some of those people.<br>
          We are a diverse campus ministry, full of people from different backgrounds and beliefs, whose goal is to live like Jesus and show others that they are loved. Our community aims to treat all people with dignity and respect, and we hope that our hospitality says enough about who we are more than any words could. CCF is a home away from home for many students, and we’d love to be yours, too.<br>
          Every week we’ll have tons of opportunities to get involved, so stop by whenever to get better connected with our community!
