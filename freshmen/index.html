          <br>
          We are about genuine community, having fun, and being a place for everyone. We're a non-denominational campus ministry called CCF at Georgia Tech. We are more than just a name and more than just another house on campus. We aren’t a place. We aren’t a program. We are everywhere on campus. We’re a diverse group and we welcome people of different backgrounds and beliefs. We live together, serve together, eat, grow and explore together. We are a community of people who want good for everyone around us. Welcome to Tech! We'd love to meet you and be your friend.
