      <div class="col-md-10"><h4>Big Kid on Campus is a day of fun at CCF and on Georgia Tech's campus for kids, siblings, sons, daughters, & grandchildren affected by cancer. We will have games, video games, a bounce house, crafts, makeovers, snacks, lunch, movies, and a Santa appearance. We also plan to play kickball with the GT Softball Team and have gym time with the GT Volleyball Team. Lunch is provided and the event is no cost to you! Feel free to drop off kids for a day of relaxation or Christmas shopping, or stay and hang out in our parents' lounge upstairs with internet access, TV, and snacks. We will have lots of adult volunteers - a ratio of at least 1 volunteer for every kid. A registered nurse will be present all day. We will serve Chick-Fil-A for lunch and have plenty to go around. Kids can come for all or part of the day. Feel free to invite friends using <a href="https://www.evite.com/event/0196S4C7IKPWOYZQGEPI42M2XLV7K4/rsvp?gid=03D7LUPW62UAGAQXMEPI42QE2EA2LE&utm_campaign=view_invitation_bt&utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=GUEST_INVITE_EVENT">this evite link</a> or else they can contact Marc Smith at marc@gtccf.org or just show up!

You may park directly behind CCF (not on the hill, but in the lot touching the back of the building).  We will have people guiding you.  You may enter our through the front glass door or the back double doors.  The doors open directly into our activity room.  It's easy.
